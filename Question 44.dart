// 44. Can a superclass access subclass member?

/*
No, a superclass cannot directly access subclass members in Dart. Inheritance 
in Dart works in one direction, where subclasses inherit members (fields and 
methods) from their superclass, but the superclass does not have access to 
members defined in its subclasses.
