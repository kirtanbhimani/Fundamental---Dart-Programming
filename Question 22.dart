// 22. Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why? B3. What is 
// advantage of inheritance? 

/*

Multiple Inheritance: Dart does not support multiple inheritance, 
meaning a class cannot inherit from multiple classes simultaneously. 
Multi-level Inheritance: In this type, a derived class is created 
from another derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.

//What is advantage of inheritance?

/* 

It promotes reusability of the code and reduces redundant code. 
It helps to design a program in a better way. It makes code simpler, 
cleaner and saves time and money on maintenance. It facilitates the 
creation of class libraries.
