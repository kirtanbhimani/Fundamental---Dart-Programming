// 28. Can an interface extend more than one interface in Dart?

/*

In Dart, interfaces do not support multiple inheritance, which means an
interface cannot extend more than one interface. 
However, a class can implement multiple interfaces1. 
If you need a type that combines the behavior of two interfaces, youâ€™ll 
have to create a class that implements both interfaces
