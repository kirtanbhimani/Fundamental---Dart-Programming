// 42. Can a subclass instance method override a superclass static method? 

/*
No, a subclass instance method cannot override a superclass static method in Dart.

In Dart, static methods belong to the class itself rather than to instances of 
the class. They are resolved at compile time based on the type of the variable 
or expression used to invoke them, not on the runtime type of the object.
