// 24. Difference between inheritance and polymorphism

/*

Inheritance is the process through which the properties 
(state and behaviour) of parent is reflected in the child. 
In OOP, inheritance is beneficial because it allows for 
code reusability and polymorphism.

Polymorphism comprise of method overloaded ( which to me is negligible usage ) 
and method overriding. Method overriding is of great usage as it 
facilitates concept of interfaces and plugin development.
